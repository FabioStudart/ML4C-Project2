Since the classes are unbalanced, we will calculate ROC-AUC metric to evaluate classifier performance. Okay?
-See Exploratory Data Analysis from part 1 for label histogram.

Due to seaborn version, heatmap figure is bad. Check if later we can use newer python and therefore update seaborn.
-See ClassicMachineLearning from part 1 for heatmap.

Performance of Random Forest and MLP classifiers is extremely high. I wasn't expecting it. I only trained kNN and NB later
to see if the task is easy or these classifiers are really good.

Could not use tsfresh correctly. Will move on to the RNN.
